  description: Suite of tools for processing DICOM datasets

  long_description: |
    DICOM is a widely established file format in medical imaging. A DICOM dataset contains rich metadata (patient, study
    info) and the actual medical image pixel or voxel data. The image data can be single-channel or multi-channel, and it
    can also be organized in multiple frames (e.g., spatial tiles of a mosaic, spatial slices, or time steps).
  
    This tool suite provides wrappers for the highdicom Python package and enables processing of DICOM datasets in Galaxy.
