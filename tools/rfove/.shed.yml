description: Perform segmentation region-based fitting of overlapping ellipses
long_description: RFOVE is completely unsupervised, operates without any assumption or prior knowledge on the objectâ€™s shape and extends and improves the Decremental Ellipse Fitting Algorithm (DEFA). Both RFOVE and DEFA solve the multi-ellipse fitting problem by performing model selection that is guided by the minimization of the Akaike Information Criterion on a suitably defined shape complexity measure. However, in contrast to DEFA, RFOVE minimizes an objective function that allows for ellipses with higher degree of overlap and, thus, achieves better ellipse-based shape approximation.
