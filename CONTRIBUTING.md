## Using the new image-based verifications for tool testing

The new image-based verifications for Galaxy tool tests https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/17556 and https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/17581 won't be available in Galaxy before 24.1 is released.

Meanwhile, they are already available in the CI of the **galaxy-image-analyis** repostiroy! ðŸŽ‰ https://github.com/BMCV/galaxy-image-analysis/pull/117

To also use them locally, you need to install the development versions of two Galaxy packages:
```python
python -m pip install git+https://git@github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git@5c1d045ce7b1e45f85608346baed5455324ee967#subdirectory=packages/util
python -m pip install git+https://git@github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git@5c1d045ce7b1e45f85608346baed5455324ee967#subdirectory=packages/tool_util
```

The commit [`5c1d045ce7b1e45f85608346baed5455324ee967`](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/commit/5c1d045ce7b1e45f85608346baed5455324ee967) corresponds to the latest merged bug fixes.

In addition, instead of running `planemo test`, you should use:
```python
planemo test --galaxy_source https://github.com/kostrykin/galaxy --galaxy_branch galaxy-image-analysis
```
The [galaxy-image-analysis branch](https://github.com/kostrykin/galaxy/tree/galaxy-image-analysis) of the <https://github.com/kostrykin/galaxy> fork is the same as the [23.1 release of Galaxy](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/release_23.1), plus the support for the image-based verification extensions.
